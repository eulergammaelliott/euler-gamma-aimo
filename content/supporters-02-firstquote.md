Using hard mathematical problems as a benchmark to determine if AI can match the highest cognitive functions of human beings is a wonderful idea. 

Every year, more than 600 of the best students from more than 110 countries are challenged with six extremely difficult IMO problems, typically only one or two students solve all six IMO problems in the allotted nine hours. These problems test their ability to formulate concepts and engage in long chains of reasoning. 

I am sure that many people will be following the AIMO Prize with great excitement, to see when, in the future, AI will match the world's brightest young minds.

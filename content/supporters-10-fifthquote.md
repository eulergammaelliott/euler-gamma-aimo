“The AIMO prize is driving progress in an area where large language models are currently weak, namely logic and reasoning. Solving this problem would be an important step towards making intelligent machines. 

A big difference between this prize and the IMO Grand Challenge is that an AIMO entrant is only given the questions in human-readable form and must give output also in human-readable form. When the IMO Grand Challenge was set up in 2019, this seemed out of reach, so we instead asked for a machine which was given computer code corresponding to the questions and had to write code corresponding to the answers. 

Recent progress in large language models makes it natural to remove this restriction, and this is exactly what the AIMO prize is doing.”

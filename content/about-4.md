The AIMO Prize runs independently. It is not formally part of the IMO or the IMO Grand Challenge. However, it aims to collaborate with IMO members and a range of Olympiad competitors in the awarding of AIMO prizes.

Further details about the prizes, competitions, and eligibility criteria will be published in the coming weeks.

The [International Mathematical Olympiad](https://www.imo-official.org/) (IMO) is a prestigious global high school maths competition. Countries enter teams of six students, who each individually attempt six highly challenging problems over two days, under exam conditions. Answers are marked by an expert panel, which awards individual gold, silver and bronze medals.

A gold medal in the IMO is a benchmark for exceptional mathematical achievement and a strong predictor of future success. IMO gold medallists are 50 times more likely to win a [Fields Medal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fields_Medal) than a typical Cambridge PhD graduate. Indeed, half of all Fields medallists participated in the IMO in their youth. 

Building on these traditions, the [AIMO Prize](/) has been established to accelerate the development of AI models that can reason mathematically to solve problems. This is a new frontier of knowledge and scientific discovery, for which the AIMO Prize could represent a new Turing Test.

The AIMO Prize is proposing three initial design principles:

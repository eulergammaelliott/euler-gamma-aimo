      p The #[b Artificial Intelligence Mathematical Olympiad] Prize (AI-MO Prize) is a new $10mn challenge fund to spur the creation of a publicly-shared AI model capable of winning a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad.
      p This includes a grand prize of $5mn for the first public AI model to enter an approved competition and perform at a standard equivalent to a gold medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad.

      p It will also include progress prizes, totalling up to $5mn, for public AI models that achieve key milestones on the journey towards the grand prize. 
      p The technical specification for the prizes will be determined by #[a(href="/get-involved") advisory committees], comprising mathematicians, AI and machine learning experts, and International Mathematical Olympiad problem-setters.

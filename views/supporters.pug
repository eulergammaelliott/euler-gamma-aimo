        p Using hard mathematical problems as a benchmark to determine if AI can match the highest cognitive functions of human beings is a wonderful idea. 
        p Every year, more than 600 of the best students from more than 110 countries are challenged with six extremely difficult IMO problems, typically only one or two students solve all six IMO problems in the allotted nine hours. These problems test their ability to formulate concepts and engage in long chains of reasoning. 
        p I am sure that many people will be following the AI-MO Prize with great excitement, to see when, in the future, AI will match the world's brightest young minds.

        p The ability of modern AI systems to create a facsimile of a human when engaging in a written exchange is remarkable. However, this works best when there is a large corpus of relevant material already placed on the internet by people. 
        p It will be a far more demanding task to mimic a creative mathematician as they engage in abstract reasoning. The global IMO community will be delighted to be involved in supporting this competition, as we seek to measure AI systems against the best young mathematical minds.

        p Despite recent advances, using AI to solve, or at least assist with solving, advanced mathematical problems remains an incredibly complicated and multifaceted challenge.  It will be important to experiment with multiple approaches to this goal, and to benchmark the performance of each of them. 
        p The AI-MO Prize promises to provide at least one such set of benchmarks which will help compare different AI problem solving strategies at a technical level, in a manner that will be accessible and appealing to the broader public.
